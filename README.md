Public Library
=======
This is a project of a database system regarding a public library.
This library lets you take books off the shelf, add them to shelves,
even move books around, view the library contents and add books
to the library database! I love books, I must say this was a very
fun project!

(What I used): Ruby
(With): Object Oriented Design Methods

(At the time of creation I was using Windows 8 and Git Bash!
So I was unable to have the full enjoyment of TDD and BDD as
well as sending it to git hub properly. I ended up having to copy
and paste the code into the repo. Since then I have been using a 
different machine (laptop instead of monster pc) with a duel 
boot system to Ubuntu so future repos will have more information
in regards to projects.)
